## Introduction ##

Library to exchange short messages (sensordata, commands) between an Arduino and a software application running on a PC. (Linux, embedded Linux, Windows, OS X)

Both sides are able send and receive a range of "standardised" messages over the serial port. All communication is done by sending short human readable ASCII messages. We define several standard command and data packet IDs to provide interoperability between different applications.
